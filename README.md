We are proud to introduce an innovative SDK developed for CXL (Compute Express Link) products. CXL, as a storage technology with tremendous potential, delivers outstanding performance and scalability to modern computer systems. Our SDK consists of the following components to meet the diverse needs of users:

Libraries: Our SDK provides a set of powerful libraries that enable developers to easily interact with CXL memory. These libraries include efficient data transfer and storage interfaces, as well as tools for managing and optimizing memory access.

Numactl: The SDK also includes the numactl tool, which allows developers to optimize memory access and task allocation on multi-core systems. By utilizing numactl, developers can better leverage the high bandwidth and low latency features of CXL memory, thereby improving the overall performance of applications.

Kernel:The SDK comes with a kernel module for CXL to ensure good compatibility and stability with the operating system. This kernel module provides low-level support, enabling developers to utilize CXL memory for high-performance computing and large-scale data processing.

System Calls: In order to seamlessly integrate with the operating system, our SDK provides essential system call interfaces, enabling developers to directly access and manage CXL memory. This allows developers to fully leverage the potential of CXL memory and achieve efficient data processing and storage.

Test Cases: To assist developers in validating and assessing the performance and stability of their applications in the CXL environment, our SDK offers a comprehensive set of test cases. These test cases span various application scenarios and workloads, aiding developers in optimizing their code to fully leverage the advantages of CXL memory.

User Guide: In order to ensure that developers can fully understand and leverage our SDK, we provide a comprehensive user guide. This guide offers clear explanations and example code to assist developers in getting started quickly and implementing best practices.

Introducing CXL memory through our SDK becomes simpler and more efficient. It reduces the burden on developers when using CXL memory and enhances application performance and reliability through built-in memory optimization strategies. Additionally, our SDK provides memory error detection tools, helping developers identify and address potential memory issues promptly, thereby improving system stability and security.

In high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, big data analytics, and other fields, our CXL SDK provides developers with powerful tools and support, empowering them to achieve outstanding application performance and innovation. By choosing our CXL SDK, you will receive top-notch technical support and excellent performance, unlocking limitless possibilities for your projects. We look forward to partnering with you to jointly shape the future of CXL memory!
